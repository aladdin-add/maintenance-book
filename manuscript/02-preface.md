# 序言

Once an initial version of software has been developed, it often becomes the subject of maintenance efforts. You will have to evolve the code to match new requirements. Doing this is challenging when technology keeps changing. Especially web development is prone to this as the stack and standards keep evolving.

一旦软件的初始版本开发完成，维护就成了主要的工作。在技术不断发展的同时，你需要开发以满足新的需求，这是非常有挑战的。尤其对web开发而言，更易受到技术栈和标准发展的影响。

Commercial open source and its adoption has changed the industry. Open source solutions have often become the new standard. The change has meant that now there are new ways for companies and individuals to collaborate. The progress hasn’t come without pains. How can you combine the interests of different parties while allowing open source projects to succeed?

商业开源软件的采用已经改变了整个行业，开源解决方案也已经成为了新的标准。对于企业和个人而言，它也提供了新的合作方式。然而这一过程并非毫无代价，你如何才能结合多方利益，来达成开源项目的成功呢？

Even though there is literature related to software maintenance and web development, it’s this intersection that deserves more attention. In this book a few other developers and I have combined our collective knowledge to allow you to maintain and develop successful projects. Although the topic is discussed from the perspective of open source, many of the techniques are applicable to private projects, as you will usually meet similar problems with those.
